## Hi there 👋 I'm Peter!

I'm a passionate software developer, builder of digital products, and forever learner.  
I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional code — from AI-powered apps to cloud infrastructure.

### 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
  - An AI assistant for macOS that blends screen understanding with smart automation  
  - A funded trading platform with challenge-based progression  
  - Beautiful, dynamic PDF templates for grant applications

- 🌱 I’m diving deep into:
  - AI model fine-tuning and dataset structuring (JSONL, GPT-style prompts)
  - Kubernetes + container orchestration
  - SwiftUI for powerful macOS & iOS experiences

- 🧠 I love:
  - Automating the boring stuff (macOS, backend tasks, document generation)
  - Building tools that feel magical ✨
  - Mixing tech with creativity (AI photo enhancers, image-to-video tools)

- 🛠 My favorite stack:
  `SwiftUI` • `C#` • `.NET` • `PostgreSQL` • `Kubernetes` • `Redis` • `Python` • `OpenAI API`

- 💬 Ask me about:
  - Building AI-first products
  - App Store dev tips
  - Hosting apps at scale with Docker & K8s
  - Trading tech, from MetaTrader APIs to challenge-based logic

- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I’m based in Moldova 🇲🇩, I love basketball 🏀, and I might be building the next smart smoker that cooks your ribs to perfection using AI 🍖🔥
